<h1 class="first">My Platform</h1>
My key focus is the reduction of systemic poverty.  I will address that issue with my 25 years of experience in economic development, community development and housing development and I pledge to give all I have to forge partnerships between Durham County and Durham’s faith community so that we address the felt needs of our less fortunate residents.  I have three top priorities to help reduce poverty:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Increase the County tax base by attracting new investment throughout Durham as appropriate;</li>
<br>
<li>Attract better paying jobs for our citizens;</li>
<br>
<li>Forge the partnerships with the faith community.</li> 

</ol>

I see these three priorities as the key to reducing systemic poverty.  I am hopeful these priorities do not warrant any significant tax increase, but can be accomplished through hard work and creativity.

<h1 class="second">Proven Leadership and Common Sense Experience</h1>

Proven Leadership serving the residents of Durham:  Over the past 20-25 years, I have served as Chairman of the Durham Area Transit Authority (DATA), the Chairman of the City of Durham Capital Program Advisory Committee, the Chairman of the Durham Convention Center Authority, the former Treasurer of Discover Durham with oversight of Durham 150 celebration, and I currently serve as the Vice Chair of Discover Durham, Durham County’s Tourism Development Authority.  In each of these roles, it was imperative to formulate and then stay on-budget.  This requires dedicated monitoring, attention to detail, and a determination to live within the adopted budget.  In the case of the Convention Center Authority, during my time as Chairman, we were able to reduce taxpayer subsidy and improve service.  During my chairmanships in the service of Durham residents, my recollection is that I did not have to request additional funds from the elected officials.
