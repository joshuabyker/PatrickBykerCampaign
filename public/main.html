                    <br> 
                     Along with their son Joshua, they enjoy the old Pink Panther (Peter Sellers) movies, road trips (primarily in North Carolina and Virginia), and grilling out.
                     Josh and Patrick have been known to spend time watching college and NFL football as well. 
                     <br>
                    After working for over five years with the Durham Chamber of Commerce, Patrick has practiced real estate law for twenty years in North Carolina, primarily in Durham, but with numerous cases across the Triangle and other parts of North Carolina.
